In this directory you can find the [server.py](server.py) python script.
You have to complete the program with the client part creating a new file called [client.py](client.py).
You can use your PC or the DaaS environment at http://daas2.tnt-lab.unige.it. In the first case you have to start the server by yourself, otherwise you can use the 
server already running in the DaaS environment.

Some useful considerations to code your program:
1. The server is listing in *localhost*, so you don't need to specify the IP address of the server in a configuration file.
   Just you can follow the code of the server.
2. The server is listening in port *65432*.
3. The client should allow to ask the command to send to the server from the user.
