In this directory you can find the [server.py](server.py) python script.
You have to complete the program with the client part creating a new file called [client.py](client.py).
You can use your PC or the DaaS environment at http://daas2.tnt-lab.unige.it. In the first case you have to start the server by yourself, otherwise you can use the 
server already running in the DaaS environment.

Some useful considerations to code your program:
1. The server is listing in *localhost*, so you don't need to specify the IP address of the server in a configuration file.
   Just you can follow the code of the server.
2. The server is listening in port *65432*.
3. The client should allow to ask the command to send to the server from the user.
4. Only one command is not listed in the help response from the server. Which one is it?
